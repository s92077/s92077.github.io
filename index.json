[{"categories":null,"contents":"After weeks of working on coursework, I thought I knew enough of life bathing in indoor lighting rather than that of some real sunshine. Deep in my heart the aspiration to get rid of all the pressure was roaring, and a trip wherever it was destined was fair enough to set me free. Supported by the clear sky this Sunday morning, the journey just took off.\nEverything should have a start, and my journey took its own in the afternoon walk in riverside park some other day, when the sign reading “10 miles to Winchester” just caught my eyes. I had been captivated by this idea since then, but not until it was elaborated with the idea to carry a bike along the footpath and ride it back that the trip was put into practice.\nAlong the river I walked, enjoying the uncommon sunshine. It seemed I was not the only one enjoying the walk on such a nice day. Every now and then I came across some jogger, fisher or walker like me, who usually greeted me with a warm smile. Moreover, since this river was in the wildlife conservation area, swans and ducklings were frequently seen throughout my journey. Seeing them swimming peacefully in river, I can tell they were enjoying the lovely sunshine as much as every British was.\nBesides the ducklings, there was something even more interesting. With the information boards along the footpath, I came to realise the river used to be cruised over by barges 300 years ago. Wooden gates of the locks were gone nowadays, with merely the brickworks holding them left here and there, though. Although they were no longer in use, they had been standing there silently for hundreds of years, as if door god we usually had in Chinese culture, guarding the well-being of this pretty river.\nOne thing I love so much about UK is that woods and fields are everywhere. Itchen Way is no exception. Sometimes, sheep dotted the field on the remote hill; sometimes, cattle and chicken were enjoying their meals. On one occasion, a pony even came toward me as I passed by. It was so adorable that I wanted to touch it. However, my attempt seemed only to frighten it. What a pity!\nIn addition to all of these, Itchen Way had much more in store. The views along the trail was quite diverse, including recreation ground with kids playing on, as well as the backyard of someone’s house. This river seemed not only to be just a river, but to be an indispensable part of their life. It was the place people walked or jogged or fished. It was the place children played and explored. It was the place someone would spend a whole afternoon reading on bench beside river in the backyard. It was the place they grew up. It reminded me of something I had long forgotten: life is, or at least should be, more than what I had been used to. I thought it was what I had long been looking for, and it was the reason I came here.\nThe whole journey was then completed by cycling back to Southampton after I arrived in Winchester. It is such a pity that my phone had run out of battery. Though the view was not as good as that along the trail, it was still quite enjoyable in the sunset. What a nice day.\nP.S. Nothing is better than having a really decent meal after a whole day trip. Thanks for Settar’s dolma. It is so delicious and impressive!\n","permalink":"http://s92077.github.io/blog/wonderful-sunday/","tags":["life"],"title":"Wonderful Sunday"}]
